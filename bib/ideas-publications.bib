%    in preparation: manuscript being prepared
%    submitted: submitted to journal or conference and under review
%    forthcoming: accepted by journal or conference
%    in press: author has made final, fully revised and copyedited
%       submission and it is now in the hands of the hand of the publisher
%    prepublished: manuscript has been published in a preliminary
%       form or location, such as an online version in advance of a
%       print publication (where final volume, issue, and page
